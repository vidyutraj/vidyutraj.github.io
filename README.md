## 🔒 Security

This portfolio uses a secure architecture where API keys are never exposed to the client:

- **Frontend** → Calls Cloudflare Worker endpoint
- **Cloudflare Worker** → Securely proxies requests to Groq API
- **API Key** → Stored only in Cloudflare's secret storage

See [CHATBOT_SECURITY.md](./CHATBOT_SECURITY.md) for detailed security documentation.

## 📝 Customization

### Updating Content

All portfolio content is in `src/data/`:

- `personal.ts` - Personal info, bio, social links
- `projects.ts` - Project listings
- `experience.ts` - Work experience
- `certifications.ts` - Certifications
- `education.ts` - Education details
- `leadership.ts` - Leadership roles
- `writing.ts` - Articles and blog posts

### Styling

- Design tokens (colour, materials, elevation) and component classes: `src/index.css`
- Type scale, colours, and shadows exposed to Tailwind: `tailwind.config.ts`
- Motion vocabulary (spring presets, momentum projection, rubber-banding): `src/lib/motion.ts`
- Component styles: Tailwind classes in component files

## 🚢 Deployment

### Frontend (GitHub Pages)

The site is automatically deployed via GitHub Actions on every push to `main`. 

**Manual deployment:**
```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### Backend (Cloudflare Worker)

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

**Quick setup:**
```bash
