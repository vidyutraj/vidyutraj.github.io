    intro: `I'm Vidyut, a sophomore at Georgia Tech who's equally obsessed with breaking things and building them back better. Most of my time is spent building hands-on cloud and security labs—because let's be honest, you only really learn when you're debugging at 2 AM or watching your infrastructure handle a load test you didn't expect it to pass.`,

      'security',

    ],
    interests: `I live at the intersection of infrastructure, security, and automation—think networking services, firewalls, multi-cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), and everything in between. I'm drawn to roles where technical depth meets real impact, where your code actually runs in production and your decisions matter. When I'm not building systems, I'm writing about them—breaking down complex topics so they actually make sense (and occasionally making fun of when things break spectacularly).`,
